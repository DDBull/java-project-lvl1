# Mind games

A bunch of mini-brain teasers that can be played on the command line. **Your boss won't notice!**
## Description
Currently, the app has 5 games: 

**Calc:** find result of the expression.

**Even:** answer whether the number is even or not.

**Progression:** find out which number is missing in the progression.

**GCD:** find the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers.

**Prime:** answer whether the number is prime number or not.

_To keep things interesting, the content of games are randomly generated each time. No boring repetitions!_
